## Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline

The synthetic data generation process consists of three stages:

### Step 1: Extraction of Tagged Data

Sentences are extracted from the Kestrel dataset such that each sentence contains a primary unnormalized entity belonging to a specific category (e.g., DATE, CARDINAL, MONEY, etc.). The sentence may either:

* Contain unnormalized entities from only that category (**Only**), or
* Contain a primary entity from the target category along with entities from other categories (**Mixed**).

The extracted files are stored as:

```text
OP_<LANGUAGE>_<KESTREL_FILE_NO>_<CATEGORY>_<Mixed/Only>.txt
```

### Step 2: Translation to Target Indic Language

The extracted tagged sentences are directly translated into the target Indic language using the NLLB-1B model without removing the category tags. It was observed that the translation model generally preserves both the unnormalized entities (such as numbers, dates, and other non-standard tokens) and their associated tags while translating the surrounding text into the target language. As a result, this step simultaneously produces translated sentences and retains the tagging information that identifies the category of each unnormalized entity, eliminating the need for a separate tagging process in the target language.
The translated files are stored as:

```text
OP_<LANGUAGE>_<KESTREL_FILE_NO>_<CATEGORY>_<Mixed/Only>_translated.txt
```

### Step 3: Generation of Normalized Data

The translated sentences are then provided to Gemini along with category-specific prompts. Gemini generates the fully normalized spoken-form representation of the unnormalized entities in the target language.

The normalized files are stored as:

```text
OP_<LANGUAGE>_<KESTREL_FILE_NO>_<CATEGORY>_<Mixed/Only>_norm.txt
```

### Directory Flow

```text
Extracted Tagged Data
└── OP_<LANGUAGE>_<KESTREL_FILE_NO>_<CATEGORY>_<Mixed/Only>.txt

Translated Data
└── OP_<LANGUAGE>_<KESTREL_FILE_NO>_<CATEGORY>_<Mixed/Only>_translated.txt

Normalized Data
└── OP_<LANGUAGE>_<KESTREL_FILE_NO>_<CATEGORY>_<Mixed/Only>_norm.txt
```
First, extraction_tagging.py is used for the extraction part, 
   second translated_tagging.py  is used for the translation part,
    third gemini_norm.py is used for obtaining the complete normalized and unnormalized data.
